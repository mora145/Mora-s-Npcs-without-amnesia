% of Amnesia: How quickly an NPC forgets a direct sighting (the higher the percentage, the faster it will forget)

High Variability: The high values of "variability" mean very variable NPCs between the times it lasts in "alert". 
Example: ranges from 10 minutes to 20 minutes, could make a npc when attacked a first time last in alert 10 minute; 
in a second attack this same NPC could last 20 minutes searching. 

Low Variability: The low values of "variability" mean little variation in NPCs between the times it lasts in "alert". 
Example: ranges from 18 minutes to 20 minutes, could make a npc when attacked a first time last in alert 18 minute; 
in a second attack this same NPC could last 20 min searching.
